## Step 1
Remove the device from the box and onto a flat surface.

If mounting on a flat surface use the following mounting holes. Either small or large magnets may be used.

## Step 4 
If mounting on a curved surface, remove the starlink crossmembers and carefully rotate the starlink such that it rests on the 
aluminum electronics box.

## Step 6
Insert the M6 nuts as shown below. Pick up the two pivot mounts with shorter bolts. If you use the pivot mounts with longer bolts, the starlink will not sit flush to the front slot. Tighten such that the mounts sit loosely and can still be rotated.

## Step 7
Place starlink back on the mounts while taking care to make sure neither of the two cables are unplugged. It should sit flush with the front slot. Replace the starlink crossmembers and tighten M4 screws.

## Step 8
Repeat this process with the back slots making sure not to tighten the bolts to much to allow them to rotate to mount flush with the curved surface.

## Step 9 
Replace covers taking care not to overtighten M4 screws and screw in either small or large magnets. Slowly lower device onto the curved mounting. Once in place, alight magnets such that they are are sitting flush with the surface by rotating pivot mounts and slightly unscrewing magnets to change height. Once all four mounts are aligned, tighten both M6 bolts on each of the 4 mounts. Pushing gently on the side of the device, the vehicle should rock side to side.
